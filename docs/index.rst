Welcome to TwisteRL
-------------------

TwisteRL is a minimalistic, high-performance Reinforcement Learning framework implemented in Rust with Python bindings.

The current version is a *Proof of Concept*, stay tuned for future releases!

üöÄ Key Features
---------------

- **High-Performance Core**: RL episode loop implemented in Rust for faster training and inference
- **Inference-Ready**: Easy compilation and bundling of models with environments into portable binaries for inference
- **Modular Design**: Support for multiple algorithms (PPO, AlphaZero) with interchangeable training and inference
- **Language Interoperability**: Core in Rust with Python interface

Quick Start
-----------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install twisterl

Training
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m twisterl.train --config examples/ppo_puzzle8_v1.json

This example trains a model to play the popular "8 puzzle" where numbers have to be shifted around through the empty slot until they are in order.

This model can be trained on a single CPU in under 1 minute (no GPU required!).

üèóÔ∏è Current State (PoC)
-----------------------

- Hybrid rust-python implementation:
    - Data collection and inference in Rust
    - Training in Python (PyTorch)
- Supported algorithms:
    - PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
    - AlphaZero
- Focus on discrete observation and action spaces
- Support for native Rust environments and for Python environments through a wrapper
