Development Roadmap
===================

This page outlines the planned development roadmap for TwisteRL, from the current Proof of Concept to a full-featured production-ready framework.

Current State (v0.1.0 - PoC)
-----------------------------

**Status**: Proof of Concept âœ…

**Key Features:**
- Hybrid Rust-Python implementation
- PPO and AlphaZero algorithms
- Discrete observation and action spaces  
- Native Rust environments and Python environment wrappers
- Basic training and inference capabilities

**Architecture:**
- Data collection and inference: Rust
- Training: Python (PyTorch)
- Environments: Rust + Python wrapper support

**Limitations:**
- Limited to discrete spaces and few available algorithms
- Minimal documentation and testing

Alpha Release (v0.2.0) - Q2 2025
---------------------------------

**Status**: In progress

**Upcoming Features (Alpha Version)**

- Full training in Rust
- Extended support for:
    - Continuous observation spaces
    - Continuous action spaces
    - Custom policy architectures
- Native WebAssembly environment support
- Streamlined policy+environment bundle export to WebAssembly
- Comprehensive Python interface
- Enhanced documentation and test coverage
- HuggingFace integration


Contributing to the Roadmap
---------------------------

**How to Influence Development:**

1. **GitHub Discussions**: Share your use cases and requirements
2. **Feature Requests**: Submit detailed feature requests with use cases
